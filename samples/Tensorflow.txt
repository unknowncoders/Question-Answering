TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning across a range of tasks. 
It is a symbolic math library, and also used as a system for building and training neural networks to detect and decipher patterns and correlations, analogous to human learning and reasoning.[3] It is used for both research and production at Google, often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on 9 November 2015.
